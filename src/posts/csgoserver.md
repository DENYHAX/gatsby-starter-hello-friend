## The first version of my csgo server just started.

## It has bhop / surf config with timer

The server ip address is <a href="steam://connect/denyhax.com" target="_blank">denyhax.com</a>


Stats about the server available <a href="https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/denyhax.com:27015/" target="_blank">here</a>

Current maplist :

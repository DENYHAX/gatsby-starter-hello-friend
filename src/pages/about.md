## Hi there

My name is Daniel and I'm the author of the blog.

I'm a 22 years old coder who tries to solve most of his problems with his own solution. I’m always ready to learn new technologies and writing clean, elegant and efficient code. On the other hand I’m not limiting myself only for coding, as a youngster I made a lot of videos for youtube(link) about my awesome Counter-Strike skills :D then I learned a lot about making and editing videos / pictures. I think I’m really open for any new direction in IT. 

Things i used:
 - Java
 - C++
 - C#
 - Linux Shell
 - Python
 - React
 - React Native
 - LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) 
 - MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, ReactJS)
 - Gatsby.js
 - Galio
 - Unity
 - Unreal Engine
 - Blender (3D Modeling)

Favorite OS: Ubuntu

Favorite music styles: Hip-Hop, Raggae
